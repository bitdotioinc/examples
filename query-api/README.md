# Query API example

This is a sample React app that makes use of the [bit.io Query API](https://docs.bit.io/reference/query_v2beta_query_post)
to dynamically load and display data directly from a database hosted on bit.io without
the need for a backend.

The app makes use of the Chinook database, hosted on bit.io [here](https://bit.io/george-bitdotio/query-api-example)

To run this app, clone this repository then, from the `query-api` directory, run:
```sh
npm i
```
to intall the dependencies, and
```sh
npm run dev
```
to run the development build of the app.
